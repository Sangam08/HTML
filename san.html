            What is nature? There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the animals, the birds, 
            the whales and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, fields and so on. Nature is not put together 
            by thought, as religion and belief are. Nature is the tiger, that extraordinary animal with its energy, 
            its great sense of power. Nature is the solitary tree in the field, the meadows and the grove; it is that squirrel 
            shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature is the ant, the bee and all the living things of the earth. Nature is the river, 
            not a particular river, whether the Ganga, the Thames or the Mississippi. Nature is those mountains, snow-clad, 
            with dark blue valleys and range of hills meeting the sea. The universe is part of nature. One must have a feeling 
            for all this, not destroy it, not kill for one’s pleasure or one’s table. We do kill cabbages, the vegetables we eat, 
            but one must draw the line somewhere. If you do not eat vegetables, how will you live? So one must intelligently 
            discern.
            See for the first time that tree, bush or blade of grass.
            Nature is part of our life. We grew out of the seed, the earth, and we are part of all that, but we are rapidly losing 
            the sense that we are animals like the others. Can you have a feeling for a tree, look at it, see the beauty of it, 
            listen to the sound it makes? Can you be sensitive to the little plant, a little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall,
